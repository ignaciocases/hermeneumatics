#scala-node [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rockymadden/scala-node.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/rockymadden/scala-node-example)
	
Proof of concept to determine if [scala.js](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js) could be leveraged to make a [node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node) module. It can.

__With this structure:__
* You can use Scala test frameworks (e.g. specs2) to test your Scala codebase prior to JavaScript compilation.
* You can use JavaScript test frameworks (e.g. mocha) to test your JavaScript codebase. This includes your scala.js compiled code.

## How-to

__Install node.js dependencies:__
```
npm install
```
---

__Build:__
```
grunt
```
Runs ```sbt main/packageJS```, then performs all grunt default tasks (e.g. compile CoffeeScript).

---

__Test:__
```
grunt test
```
Runs all build items above, runs ```sbt test/test```, and finally runs Mocha based tests.

---

__Publish to NPM:__
```
npm publish
```
Runs build items above prior.
